AIMS
> generic transition systems seen as a function
  S -> F S
  where S is the set of states.
  (for each action/letter)

> generic alphabet, not necessarily sequentially --> tree automata

TASKS

> Simple examples for motivating the first task
  * deterministic automata (F = Id)
  * non deterministic automata (F = finitePowerset or F = List)
